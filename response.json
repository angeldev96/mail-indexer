Let me thank you f=\r\nor the help and loving kindness you and ENRON has shown to me during the pe=\r\nriod after the devasting floods.  I've never worked for such a wonderful co=\r\nmpany before, the people here in every walk of life are so very friendly.  =\r\nThe scriptures speaks of drawing people toward you with loving kindness, an=\r\nd you certainly have here at ENRON.  The people that i've met here want to =\r\nbe here and that's a good sign.  One morning on the elevator a lady was sin=\r\nging on the way to her floor, i didn't recognize the tune right away, proba=\r\nbly because it was early morning, the tune turned out to be \"OKLAHOMA\" so I=\r\n joined her, she invited me to come and be a part of the ENRON CHOIR.  Just=\r\n  the other day you Mr. Skilling passed my desk and asked had my group just=\r\n moved to the 31st floor, i've only been here at ENRON since January '01 an=\r\nd wasn't aware that my group had moved from the 29th floor.  My Grandmother=\r\n always used to tell me as a child, \"you better keep a thought in mind, tha=\r\nt someones watching you, and they want to be just like you, setting their e=\r\nxamples by you, and they're never gonna miss a single thing you do.  And I =\r\nlive by that today.  Well I can be a little longwinded,  but remember:\r\n\r\nIf I can help somebody  as I pass along,\r\nIf I can cheer somebody with a word or song,\r\nIf I can can show somebody that he's traveling wrong,\r\nThen my living shall not be in vain.\r\n\r\nAnd you both have certainly obeyed that dictum.\r\n\r\n\r\nGod Bless You Both,\r\n\r\n\r\nGlenn B.

If you need me to work I will, but if somebody else really wants the extra money I don't mind not working.  If I had my preference I would rather work Christmas than Thanksgiving so I could go to College Station and watch the Aggies smack around the over-rated Longhorns (be sure to show that part to Reece).  As far as vacation I would like to take off Nov. 2-5 and then maybe some time around Thanksgiving if I'm off.  I still have all of my vacation and I'm not sure how much I can carry over.  One other thing, some buddies of mine are going to Vegas the weekend of Oct. 27, I'm scheduled to work Sat. Night with two other guys, I would take a vacation day that day if you think we can get by with just two people on a Sat night.  Anyway, I'm not real particular, if you need me to work I'll be there if not then I won't.  See you Thur.\n \nSeely\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Hernandez, Juan \nSent: Sun 9/30/2001 9:37 PM \nTo: Blaine, Jay; Collins, Dustin; Errigo, Joe; Greer, Andrew; Larkworthy, Carrie; Maskell, David; Rawal, Punit; Reves, Brant; Seely, Michael; Trejo, Reese \nCc: Baughman Jr., Don; Laurent, Dean; Garcia, Miguel L. \nSubject: November and December Vacation\n\n\nHey guys and girls with the Holiday's fast approaching I am looking for a good few men and women to work the holidays.  These volunteers can work the Thanksgiving weekend, Christmas and New Years day.  You can work all of these days or just some of them.  Keep in mind that holiday pay is involved.  Let me know your preferences when you e-mail me your response.  If I get more volunteers than we need, then we will draw straws on who gets to work what holidays.  Also please e-mail your vacation request if you have any for the November and December Schedule.  The sooner I get everyones response the faster I can get the schedules out for November and December.  I almost forgot, in your e-mail let me know much you would like to work the holidays: very much, don't care one way or another, or don't want to work them at all.    That is all!!!"
